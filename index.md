## About Me

I'm a recent graduate in Computer Engineering with a strong foundation in embedded systems, software development, and hardware integration. I've completed multiple internships across engineering domains and enjoy building solutions that live at the intersection of code and electronics.

Currently, I’m exploring opportunities in embedded software, system design, and R&D engineering.
